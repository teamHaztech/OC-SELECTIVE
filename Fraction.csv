Boy  bought 4 25 kg of flour. he used 3 23 kg while baking cake. How much sugar did he have left?,120 kg,88 KG ,105 kg ,115 kg,D," Total flour bought by Ruby = 4 25 kg 
Flour used for baking cake = 3 23 kg
Total flour remained= Total flour bought – flour used for baking cake
First convert the mixed fraction into proper fraction
Therefore 4 25 kg = 5x4+25;= 225 kg
3 23 kg = 3x3x23 =113 kg
225 - 113 ; = 3x22-5x1115; = 66-5515;= 115"
"If 4 13 m of rod is cut from a piece of 15 m long rod, how much of rod is left?","220 m
"," 50 m
","323 m
", 97 m,C,"Total length of rod = 15m
Fraction of the rod cut out = 4 13 m =  133 m
Length of the rod left = 15m -  133 ; = 3x15-1x133; = 45-133; = 323m
Therefore 323m of rod is left"
"A train arrives at the station with 210 passengers on board. 23 of the passengers get off the train in Parramatta, and then 45 passengers board the train. How many passengers are on the train when it leaves the station?",115,65,90,125,A,"Passengers in train = 210
People get off the train = 23 of 210 = 23 x 210 = 140
People left in train = 210-140=70 
Number of passenger get into train=45
Number of passengers on train when it leaves the station = 70+45 = 115
Therefore number of passenger on train when it leaves is 115.
